# SIEMsational CTF
I completed this project as part of CodePathâ€™s CYB102 cybersecurity course to apply Splunk skills in a Capture-the-Flag (CTF) challenge. The goal was to solve security-related questions by searching through logs and datasets in Splunk. After completing this project, I strengthened my ability to write SPL search queries, analyze log data, and investigate simulated cyber incidents using Splunkâ€™s Search and Reporting tools. Although I did not provide a screenshot of every challenge, I took some screenshots of the ones I thought were pretty cool and interesting.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS VM
- Splunk Enterprise (SIEM platform)
- Netflix dataset
- PathCode Inc. simulated attack logs

## What This Project Does
- Uses Splunk to solve CTF-style challenges across two datasets: Netflix data and simulated malware investigation logs.
- Builds search queries to analyze user login attempts, file uploads, and malware indicators.
- Identifies attack patterns such as unauthorized logins and file uploads by filtering through log fields.
- Answers incident investigation questions like identifying the attackerâ€™s IP, user agents, and file hashes.
- Practices cybersecurity log analysis in a competitive environment to build real-world SIEM skills.

## Screenshots
### Finding what usernames the malicious IP address tried to log in as, and what username was used to upload the malware (Challenge 12)

### Identifying the IP and username that sent the malicious file (Challenge 14-15)
- As you can see, the IP that sent "EvilScript.exe" is 192.168.1.10. We can see that the username "ABurke" uploaded this file.
